# 💼 SDFPP Resume Project

Welcome to your first major **portfolio project** in the Software Development Program is a resume project (SDFPP). In this challenge, using a [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/fM2tutgIH0k1SrNir4MVe3/SDF-Resume-Project-STUDENT-REFERENCE-FILE?node-id=0-1&t=yGSXI1yv4AgjKBvA-1) as reference, you’ll create your very own online resume — a personal website that shows off your skills, experience, and code style using **HTML and CSS**.

This is not just practice — this is something you can proudly include in your portfolio and share with future employers!

## 🎥 Presentation Video

## 🧠 What You'll Build

You will build a fully responsive, Figma-matching resume site that includes the following sections:

- Profile & Summary
- Proficiency Bars
- Skills Tags
- Projects Grid
- Education & Work History
- Tools Section

---

## 🧪 How You’ll Be Marked

Your project will be assessed using **two components**:

### ✅ 1. Code & Layout Marking 
Each section of your resume site is scored based on:
- Use of semantic HTML and correct structure
- Accurate styling, spacing, typography, and colour matching the Figma
- Pixel accuracy for layout and alignment
- Responsive layout on mobile screens
- Clean and well-structured code
- Functional and visually polished components
- Accessibility (e.g., alt text for images and icons)

> A full breakdown of the scoring rubric is available on your Dashboard. Each feature is mapped to a clear user story and assigned a difficulty rating. Some features offer bonus points for pixel-perfection ✨

### 🎙️ 2. Recorded Presentation 
You must record a **5–10 minute** screen presentation of your project using Loom, OBS, or any screen recorder.

You will be scored on:
- How well you explain your code and decisions
- Understanding and communication of the project brief
- Visual walkthrough of your site and responsiveness
- Presentation skills (confidence, clarity, visual aids)

## 🎙️ My Presentation Script

Below is the outline I followed when recording my 5–10 minute presentation for this project. It helped me explain my site, code, layout decisions, and what I’ve learned.

### 🟢 1. Introduction (30 sec – 1 min)

Hi, I’m Phillip-Rossouw Botha, and this is my resume website project built entirely using HTML and CSS.

This project taught me how to take a Figma design and translate it into a clean, responsive, and pixel-perfect website using only frontend tools.

One thing I’m especially proud of is how accurately I matched the layout, including the spacing, font sizes, and mobile responsiveness — without using any JavaScript or frameworks.

### 🟢 2. Walkthrough of the Resume (2–3 min)

#### 🧑‍💼 Profile & Summary

The site starts with my name, a short summary, and a circular profile image.
I wrote my summary to quickly describe who I am: a student developer and web-hosting tech who’s transitioning into frontend development.
I structured this section in HTML using a `<header>` tag, with a container that uses Flexbox to position the text and image side-by-side on desktop and stacked on mobile.

#### 📊 Proficiency Bars

Next are the proficiency bars — I used a container div for each skill, then a nested div with a class to represent the fill percentage.
The widths are controlled in CSS using percentage widths like 90%, 80%, etc., to match the Figma design exactly.

#### 🏷️ Skills Tags

For the skills section, I chose key tools I’ve worked with.
I used a simple grid layout with `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` and styled each skill as a tag using padding, borders, and consistent font sizing.

#### 🛠️ Projects

I included a section that highlights some of the projects I’ve worked on.
Each project card is structured using semantic HTML and styled with cards that have hover effects.
One project I’m proud of is [insert short mention of project title here] — I made sure each card has a title, role, and relevant tech stack icons.

#### 🎓 Education & 💼 Experience

This section displays my education and work history.
I followed the 2-column layout on desktop and a stacked layout on mobile.
I styled the date and details using grid and ensured spacing matched the design.

#### 🔗 Footer

At the bottom, I have a clean footer with working links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.
Each icon or text link has a hover effect, and all are accessible and functional.

### 🟢 3. Responsiveness Demo (30 sec)

As you can see when I resize the browser, the layout adjusts seamlessly to mobile.
I used media queries and mobile-first CSS to change font sizes, padding, and layout direction.
For example, the header image and text stack vertically, the grid layouts collapse to single columns, and spacing is adjusted to fit smaller screens.

The education section was the trickiest to make responsive — I used `grid-template-areas` and `minmax()` to control how the content reflows.

### 🟢 4. Code Overview (2–3 min)

#### 🔍 HTML Structure

In my `index.html`, I kept things semantic and accessible.
I used `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to logically group the page content.
I avoided unnecessary `div` nesting and kept my class names consistent and readable — like `.skills-grid` or `.project-card`.

#### 🎨 CSS Organisation

My CSS is organized into sections: I began with a reset, then global styles like fonts and colors, then specific sections.
I used variables for color and font sizes to stay consistent with the Figma design.

#### 💡 Layout Challenges

One challenge was aligning the profile section image perfectly — I fixed this using `align-items: center` in Flexbox and careful margin tweaks.
Another was spacing the skills and education sections, where I used Grid and `gap` properties to handle that cleanly.

#### 🧠 Bonus Features

Some added touches include hover effects on buttons and links, and smooth transitions using `transition: all 0.3s ease;`.

### 🟢 5. Reflection (1 min)

The most challenging part was getting the layout to match Figma exactly, especially across devices.
But once I broke it into sections and used a mobile-first approach, it became easier to test each part on its own.

I’m proud of how clean and responsive the final result is, and that I didn’t rely on any frameworks — just raw HTML and CSS.

Next time, I’d love to explore adding JavaScript interactivity and maybe improving accessibility even more with ARIA labels.
